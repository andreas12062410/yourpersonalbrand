# Your Curriculum (or resume)

Securing an interview requires a polished resume that highlights your work experience, qualifications, and technical skills. Your resume needs to effectively communicate that you have the skills and experience required for the position. As a web developer, you aren’t expected to be a graphic design expert, but a well designed resume can make a big difference. Most recruiters only spend a few seconds on their initial resume scan.

Writing the perfect resume is less about showing how great you are and more about showing the hiring person why you’re the ideal person to help them reach their goals. The key to doing this is being relevant and to the point. In this guide you will find a few important resume writing tips and resources to help you get started:

**1. The Do’s & Don’ts of Resume Writing**

- **Technical assignments (TA):** This is the bulk of this module. You'll prepare for the job interview process, by making _real_ technical assignments that come from _real_ companies. During the first (and third) week you will have to make an assignment that complies with all the requirements. The second (and fourth) week you will take the applications to the next level by designing and implementing new features and functionality.
- **Videos:** Every week you will have to record a video explaining a concept youve learned. In Week 4 you will also have to prepare a video job application which  will be your 'test' to see to what degree you are able to present yourself professionally and confidently.
- **Plannings and learnings:** On weeks 1 and 3 you will share your planning on which technologies you will use for the upcoming TA and which features you will add in weeks 2 and 4. Additionally, every week you will share a small message with your group mentioning what you have learned by working on the TA.
- **Questionnaires:** Every week you'll have to complete a simple questionnaire containing common interview questions that will challenge you to think about what you want out of your career. Put time to think about the answers as these can be usef in any real interview.
