# Your Curriculum (or resume)

Securing an interview requires a polished resume that highlights your work experience, qualifications, and technical skills. Your resume needs to effectively communicate that you have the skills and experience required for the position. As a web developer, you aren’t expected to be a graphic design expert, but a well designed resume can make a big difference. Most recruiters only spend a few seconds on their initial resume scan.

Writing the perfect resume is less about showing how great you are and more about showing the hiring person why you’re the ideal person to help them reach their goals. The key to doing this is being relevant and to the point. In this guide you will find a few important resume writing tips and resources to help you get started:
